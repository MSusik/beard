def cluster_assignment(old_clusters, new_clusters, similarity_function,
                       claims={}, rejected={}):
    """Match results of the disambiguation with the present clusters.

    In the usual case, the results of disambiguation will have to be integrated
    into a production database. Before the run of the algorithm, the clusters
    might have been associated to records in the system. Thus, the results
    need to be matched to the existing records.

    This problem can be represented as an assignment problem in a bipartite
    graph. To solve it, the Hungarian algorithm is used.

    In the assignment problem one needs to specify the costs between vertices.
    Here the cost is computed by ``similarity_function`` which takes a single
    old cluster and a single new cluster as arguments.

    Important to note is that one can specify claimed and rejected entities
    for records. After the run of the Hungarian algorithm claimed entities
    will be moved to clusters to which they belonged before and the same
    will happen to rejected entities if they were reassigned to clusters
    where they were rejected.

    Parameters
    ----------
    :old_clusters: dict
        Old clusters. The keys are ids of clusters in the systems
        (record ids) and the values are lists of entities belonging to these
        records before.

    :new_clusters: dict
        Result of the disambiguation

    :similarity_function: function
        Cost function. Its signature is

        .. code-block:: python

           def similarity(new_cluster, old_cluster, claims, rejections)

        Where:

        - ``new_cluster`` is the list of entities from the new cluster
        - ``old_cluster`` is the list of entities from the old cluster
        - ``claims`` is the list of claims which were claimed by this record
          in the past.
        - ``rejections`` is the list of entities that should not belong to
          this record.

        Note that claimed and rejected entities might reassigned after solving
        the assignment problem. There is no need to take care of it inside
        the cost function, although it still might be useful.

        The function should return a number. Here is a simple example:

        .. code-block:: python

           def similarity(new_cluster, old_cluster, claims, rejections):
               return -len(set(new_cluster).intersection(old_cluster))

    :claims: dict
        Claimed entities. The keys are ids of clusters in the system and the
        values are lists of entitites claimed by these records before.

    :rejected: dict
        Claimed entities. The keys are ids of clusters in the system and the
        values are lists of entitites rejected by corresponding records before.

    Returns
    -------
    :returns: tuple
        The first element is a dictionary with record ids as keys and lists
        of entities as values. It is a result of matching. Some entities
        might not be matched and they are returned as the list of lists (list
        of clusters) - the second element in the returned tuple.
